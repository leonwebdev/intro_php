# LAB 4 INSTRUCTIONS

Use this as the basic structure for your lab.

Create a git branch before your begin.

```
git checkout -b lab4
```

Copy the folders and files in the starter archive into your lab 4 folder, then add, commit and push them

```
git add .
git commit -m 'Started files copied to lab'
git push
```

Now, you can begin your work.

Make frequent adds and commits as you work.  (I expect to see 8 to 10 commits while you work on this lab).

When you are finished, add, commit and push all your work to BitBucket.

Log into BitBucket with your browser, and in your course repository, create a pull request for your work.  You should be able to merge it on BitBucket immediately.

Locally, checkout your master branch, then pull your merged work from Bit Bucket:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull
```

Now, add a line to your repository README:

```
* Intro PHP Lab 4 complete
```

Make a final add, commit and push to BitBucket.

You are done!
